# HP autologin
This userscript logs you automatically on IPSA's HyperPlanning and shows the latest timetable.

Please visit [this page](http://magixkiller.github.io/HP_autologin/) for download and install instructions.
Feel free to open a support ticket if anything doesn't work as expected !

It should work on any HyperPlanning website with minor tweaks.

I hope this will be useful, Thanks for using :)
